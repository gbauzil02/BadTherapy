# BadTherapy
Language: Python
  
Description: This project is my submission for the 2021 Terrible Hackathon for the Programming Team at my university
in which I received 3rd place. Completed in about an 1 hour and 15 minutes, this program offers the illusion 
of advice, but ultimately tells the user to speak to an actual human being rather than a python program. Lastly,
at the end of the program, this bad therapist asks for your rating and gives you a response based on your choice.

Progress: Right now, the program is fully functional and complete, so I do not intend on adding on to it.
