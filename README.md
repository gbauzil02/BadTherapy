# BadTherapy
<title>Bad Therapy</title>
<p>Language: Python</p>
<p>Description: This project is my submission for the 2021 Terrible Hackathon for the Programming Team at my university-NJIT.</p>
              <p>in which I received 3rd place. Completed in about an 1 hour and 15 minutes, this program offers the illusion </p>
              <p>of advice, but ultimately tells the user to speak to an actual human being rather than a python program. Lastly,</p>
              <p>at the end of the program, this bad therapist asks for your rating and gives you a response based on your choosing.</p>
<p>Progress: Right now, the program is fully functional and complete, so I do not intend on adding on to it. </p>
